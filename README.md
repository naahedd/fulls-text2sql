That's full-stack application  designed to generate intuitive SQL queries from natural language descriptions.
Using React for the front end, users can enter plain English descriptions of the data they need, and the application translates these descriptions into SQL queries. 
The backend, built with Node.js and Express, handles the processing and interacts with the ChatGPT API to convert natural language into accurate SQL commands. 
The ChatGPT API interprets the user input and outputs a generated corresponding SQL query. SQL is very similar to Natural Language so I think this can be helpful for people to be able to start learning SQL in an intuitive way.
Especially those with a little experience with programming languages
